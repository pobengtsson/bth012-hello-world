# bth012-hello-world
The Classic Hello World example as a node.js project with the course settings for linting.

## Setup

First thing to do after cloning this repo is to run `npm install` to install all development dependencies and tools like eslint.

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Run the program

```bash
$ node index.js
```

## The code

The code is a single line using the global object `console` and its method `log` to, that's right, log a _Hello World_ message to the console.

## Linting

A deliberate linting error in the source code to show an example of how a linting error/warning looks like.
Can you fix the problem so the linting error is closed?
